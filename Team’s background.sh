# teamsbackground.sh
#
# Author: Tobias AlmÃ©n
#
# Version: 1.0
#
# This script downloads an image, resizes it, and sets it as a custom background image for Microsoft Teams (work or school).
#
# Usage:
# ./teamsbackground.sh
#
# Details:
# The script uses the `sips` command, a built-in utility on macOS for image processing, and `curl` for downloading the image.
# It sets a custom background image for Microsoft Teams by placing the image in the appropriate directory.
#
# In this script:
# - TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d): This command creates a temporary directory.
# - BACKGROUND_URL: This is the URL of the image to download.
# - BACKGROUND_FOLDER: This is the directory where Microsoft Teams looks for custom background images.
# - curl -f -s -O "$BACKGROUND_URL": This command downloads the image.
# - process_image function: This function processes the image. It checks if the image is in the defined formats (png, jpg, jpeg), converts it to PNG if it's not, renames it to a generated UUID, copies it to the background folder, resizes it to a height of 186 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio, and then crops it to have a width of 238 pixels.
# - The script also checks if it has been run before and if Microsoft Teams is installed. If the script has been run before, it exits. If Microsoft Teams is not installed, it prints an error message and exits.
# - If the image is a zip file, the script unzips it and processes the extracted files.
#
# Requirements:
# - Microsoft Teams must be installed and the user must have write access to the Microsoft Teams background images directory.
